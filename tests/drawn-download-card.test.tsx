/**
 * THE DOWNLOAD CARD, AS THE RATIFIED DRAWING DRAWS IT (the review drawing §V.2).
 *
 * VERBATIM: "it belongs to a base of its own, and that base's display is the
 * download card — the file's name, its form, its size, and the download — and no
 * reading of the bytes, because there is none to make." And: "It has no tabs and
 * nothing else to put in a header, so it carries no header strip at all: the
 * file, and the download."
 *
 * FOUR PARTS, AND NOTHING APPENDED TO THEM. The card the drawing draws reads
 *
 *   upgrade-road-notes.bin
 *   application/octet-stream · 2.4 MB
 *   Download
 *
 * — a name, a form beside a size, and a control that says one word. This display
 * carried a fifth part the drawing does not give: a sentence telling the reader
 * what to do with the file, and a control that said what it was downloading. A
 * proof round graded both of them as deviations from the drawn card.
